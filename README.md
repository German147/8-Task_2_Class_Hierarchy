Task NÂ°2- Designing hierarchycal classes

##Hierarchical Classes Implementation

In this project I chose to make classes related to university and I tried to implement some methods between them. 
There is a UserInteractionClass, it is to make the application more friendly to use

Next, there is an image of a UML diagram indicating the relationship among classes.
